Cromby database install scripts
-------------------------------

Developed on PostgreSQL v9.1

Status: In development.

Instructions (*nix/OS X)

1.  Run create_db as the postgres user to create databases and owner.  You may want to change the owner and/or password first.

2.  Navigate to the CrombyDB directory, run script or similar to catch session output, then connect to the target database using psql as the owner created in Step 1.

3.  Execute the command \i install.sql to create the database objects.  This will also create a log file called cromby_install.log.
